                <p>
                    My name is R. Muhammad Shaariq, and I am a 1st year student at AMET University.
                    <br><br>
                    My primary area of study is computer programming, with a strong focus on C++ , HTML , CSS and Java Script. I have a solid foundation in mathematics, particularly in combinatorics and permutations, and I enjoy applying these logical skills to my coding projects.
                    <br><br>
                    Alongside my programming interests, I am also studying physics and am fascinated by wave mechanics and how different systems interact. In my personal time, I follow the latest in consumer technology, especially smart home ecosystems and hardware.
                    <br><br>
                    I was born in 2007 in Chennai. From childhood I have had a strong interest in computer science and technology. I spent a lot of time watching YouTube videos to stay updated on the latest software and hardware developments, which deepened my interest in computers. Later I enrolled in the Kalvium B.Tech program at AMET University — a course focused on computer science that does not include chemistry, which was a big relief since chemistry was my least favorite and most difficult subject in school. AMET is about 33 km from my home, but I decided to join and I am very grateful I did: the college environment is good, the students are supportive, and the mentors are always willing to help and clear my doubts. I am currently in my first year of the Kalvium B.Tech program, and my goal after graduation is to get a placement at Google with a starting salary of at least 12 lakh per annum. Wish me luck for my future.
